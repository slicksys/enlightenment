## Welcome Slicksys Development Enlightenment

### Definiation: 
European intellectual movement of the late 17th and 18th centuries emphasizing reason and individualism rather than tradition. 

## Philosophy
In the world of software development and design, enlightenment can be viewed as a heightened state of understanding and insight, reaching a deep, intuitive understanding of the complexities and nuances of technology. For a developer, this means transcending beyond the basic functionality of code to appreciate and harness its potential to solve real-world problems creatively and efficiently. It's about seeing beyond the immediate task to the broader impact of one's work, understanding user needs and experiences at a fundamental level, and integrating this insight into the design process. In this way, enlightenment in software development becomes synonymous with innovation, precision, and user-centric thinking, leading to solutions that are not only technically robust but also elegantly tailored to meet and exceed the expectations and needs of the end user. This enlightened approach is crucial in a rapidly evolving tech landscape, enabling developers to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional, impactful software products.

### Purpose
Building on the philosophy of enlightened software development, where understanding, innovation, and user-centric design are paramount, I am embarking on a journey of experimentation with code. This will not only involve pushing the boundaries of traditional coding practices but also diving into new and unexplored territories of programming. Alongside this exploration, I am committed to sharing my knowledge and experiences through teaching, aiming to illuminate the path for others in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. My journey will also include candidly sharing my opinions on current methods used in software development, critiquing them not just for their technical merits but for their ability to truly resonate with and meet user needs. This approach, rooted in a deep understanding and insightful critique, will hopefully contribute to a more intuitive and impactful way of developing software.
